  <img src="kate_hudson.jpeg">
  <h3>Kate Hudson</h3>
  <p>Almost everyone who has spent time with Kate Hudson -including 
  directors, family members, co-stars and interviewers - is quick to 
  comment on her ability to light up a room. Through some combination of 
  a winning smile, solid work ethic, and good old-fashioned talent, the 
  young actress has gone from indie beginner to Vanity Fair cover girl 
  in just three years. (Source: IMDB)</p>
